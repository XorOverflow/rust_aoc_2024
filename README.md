# rust_aoc_2024

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles, written in Rust.

Hopefully of better quality than in 2023 from gained experience !

Compared to 2023, this repo will also try to include improved versions of
the solution code in addition to the initial "good enough" hack used to submit
an answer. For example by maintaining a tools crate reusable by multiple
solutions (such as parsing of the input text)
