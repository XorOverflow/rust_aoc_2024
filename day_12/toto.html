<h1 id="day-12">Day 12</h1>
<p>Parse stdin, so just redirect the input file with shell:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">cargo</span> run <span class="op">&lt;</span> input.txt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Accepts -d for colorized map output debugging (<code>cargo run -- -d &lt; input.txt</code>)</p>
<p><img src="color_output2.png" /></p>
<p>Accepts -v for the verbose list of all regions detected</p>
<p><img src="color_output1.png" /></p>
<p>Colors will use all the ANSI colors except black, to display on my black background terminal.</p>
<h2 id="algo">Algo</h2>
<p>Pretty simple (it’s only day 12). From the initial input matrix of letters, create a second matrix of individual regions by using a flood-filling algo on each region for matrix cells not yet processes.</p>
<p>The floodfill function fills a contiguous row, then recursively calls itself for pixels above and under.</p>
<p>No trick except I was stuck on a off-by-one bug on the floodill algo that overshoot the min and max X of the row by 1, causing a particular case of connecting two different regions by their corners.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part 1 then just re-parses the full region matrix, and for each cell add 1 to its corresponding region area counter (All regions are maintained in a preallocated Vec, no need for hashmap). Perimeter is increased each time an adjacent cell is not on the region.</p></li>
<li><p>Part 2 modifies the part 1 function (no need to create a second function, both can be done on the same loop).</p>
<ul>
<li>Side counting is done by ignoring adjacent “same side” perimeter; the initial idea was to count 1 for the first time a perimeter orientation is encountered (top, left, right, bottom) then ignore when the next cell would give the same perimeter limit.</li>
<li>Without “following the sides” like a maze, but by only iterating on all X and Y linearly, the equivalent is to simply count the corners of the regions.</li>
<li>In practice, for each perimeter test, we test if a previous cell on this side direction (perpendicular to the delta (x,y) use to compare the adjacent cell) is also in the region and is also different from its own adjacent cell. If yes, it’s a continuation of the side, don’t count anything. If no, something changed and we are at the corner or start of a new side: count 1.</li>
</ul></li>
